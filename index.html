            <strong>Full Name: </strong>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso
            Realonda
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Early Life: </strong>José Rizal was born in 1861 to
            Francisco Rizal Mercado y Alejandro and Teodora Alonso Realonda y
            Quintos in the town of Calamba in Laguna province. He had nine
            sisters and one brother. From an early age, José showed a precocious
            intellect. He learned the alphabet from his mother at 3, and could
            read and write at age 5. Upon enrolling at the Ateneo Municipal de
            Manila, he dropped the last three names that made up his full name,
            on the advice of his brother, Paciano and the Mercado family, thus
            rendering his name as "José Protasio Rizal". Despite the name
            change, José, as "Rizal", soon distinguished himself in poetry
            writing contests, impressing his professors with his facility with
            Castilian and other foreign languages, and later, in writing essays
            that were critical of the Spanish historical accounts of the
            pre-colonial Philippine societies.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Education: </strong>Rizal first studied under Justiniano
            Aquino Cruz in Biñan, Laguna, before he was sent to Manila. As to
            his father's request, he took the entrance examination in Colegio de
            San Juan de Letran but he then enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de
            Manila and graduated as one of the nine students in his class
            declared sobresaliente or outstanding. He continued his education at
            the Ateneo Municipal de Manila to obtain a land surveyor and
            assessor's degree, and at the same time at the University of Santo
            Tomas where he did take up a preparatory course in law and finished
            with a mark of excelente or excellent. He finished the course of
            Philosophy as a pre-law. Upon learning that his mother was going
            blind, he decided to switch to medicine at the medical school of
            Santo Tomas specializing later in ophthalmology. He received his
            four-year practical training in medicine at Ospital de San Juan de
            Dios in Intramuros. In his last year at medical school, he received
            a mark of sobresaliente in courses of Patologia Medica (Medical
            Pathology), Patología Quirúrgica (Surgical Pathology) and
            Obstretics.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Personal Life: </strong>Shortly after he graduated from the
            Ateneo Municipal de Manila (now Ateneo de Manila University), Rizal
            (who was then 16 years old) and a friend, Mariano Katigbak, came to
            visit Rizal's maternal grandmother in Tondo, Manila. Mariano brought
            along his sister, Segunda Katigbak, a 14-year-old Batangueña from
            Lipa, Batangas. It was the first time they met and Rizal described
            Segunda as "rather short, with eyes that were eloquent and ardent at
            times and languid at others, rosy–cheeked, with an enchanting and
            provocative smile that revealed very beautiful teeth, and the air of
            a sylph; her entire self diffused a mysterious charm." His
            grandmother's guests were mostly college students and they knew that
            Rizal had skills in painting. They suggested that Rizal should make
            a portrait of Segunda. He complied reluctantly and made a pencil
            sketch of her. Unfortunately for Rizal who had referred to her as
            his first love in his memoir Memorias de un Estudiante de Manila,
            Katigbak was already engaged to Manuel Luz.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>In Brussels and Spain (1890–92): </strong>In 1890, Rizal,
            29, left Paris for Brussels as he was preparing for the publication
            of his annotations of Antonio de Morga's Sucesos de las Islas
            Filipinas (1609). He published Dimanche des Rameaux (Palm Sunday), a
            socio-political essay, in Berlin on 30 November 1886. He discussed
            the significance of Palm Sunday in socio-political terms: "This
            entry [of Jesus into Jerusalem] decided the fate of the jealous
            priests, the Pharisees, of all those who believed themselves the
            only ones who had the right to speak in the name of God, of those
            who would not admit the truths said by others because they have not
            been said by them. That triumph, those hosannas, all those flowers,
            those olive branches, were not for Jesus alone; they were the songs
            of the victory of the new law, they were the canticles celebrating
            the dignification of man, the liberty of man, the first mortal blow
            directed against despotism and slavery".[38] Shortly its
            publication, Rizal was summoned by the German police who suspected
            him of being a French spy.
          </p>

          <p>
            The content of Rizal's writings changed considerably in his two most
            famous novels, Noli Me Tángere, published in Berlin in 1887, and El
            Filibusterismo, published in Ghent in 1891. For the latter, he used
            funds borrowed from his friends. These writings angered both the
            Spanish colonial elite and many educated Filipinos due to their
            symbolism. They are critical of Spanish friars and the power of the
            Church. Rizal's friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, an
            Austria-Hungary-born professor and historian, wrote that the novel's
            characters were drawn from real life and that every episode can be
            repeated on any day in the Philippines.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Return to Philippines (1892–96): </strong>Upon his return to
            Manila in 1892, he formed a civic movement called La Liga Filipina.
            The league advocated these moderate social reforms through legal
            means, but was disbanded by the governor. At that time, he had
            already been declared an enemy of the state by the Spanish
            authorities because of the publication of his novel.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Exile in Dapitan: </strong>Rizal was implicated in the
            activities of the nascent rebellion and in July 1892, was deported
            to Dapitan in the province of Zamboanga, a peninsula of Mindanao.
            There he built a school, a hospital and a water supply system, and
            taught and engaged in farming and horticulture. Abaca, then the
            vital raw material for cordage and which Rizal and his students
            planted in the thousands, was a memorial.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Arrest and Trial: </strong>By 1896, the rebellion fomented
            by the Katipunan, a militant secret society, had become a full-blown
            revolution, proving to be a nationwide uprising. Rizal had earlier
            volunteered his services as a doctor in Cuba and was given leave by
            Governor-General Ramón Blanco to serve in Cuba to minister to
            victims of yellow fever. Rizal and Josephine left Dapitan on August
            1, 1896, with letter of recommendation from Blanco.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rizal was arrested en route to Cuba via Spain and was imprisoned in
            Barcelona on October 6, 1896. He was sent back the same day to
            Manila to stand trial as he was implicated in the revolution through
            his association with members of the Katipunan. During the entire
            passage, he was unchained, no Spaniard laid a hand on him, and had
            many opportunities to escape but refused to do so.
          </p>

          <p>
            While imprisoned in Fort Santiago, he issued a manifesto disavowing
            the current revolution in its present state and declaring that the
            education of Filipinos and their achievement of a national identity
            were prerequisites to freedom. Rizal was tried before a
            court-martial for rebellion, sedition and conspiracy, and was
            convicted on all three charges and sentenced to death. Blanco, who
            was sympathetic to Rizal, had been forced out of office. The friars,
            led by then-Archbishop of Manila Bernardino Nozaleda had
            'intercalated' Camilo de Polavieja in his stead as the new Spanish
            Governor-General of the Philippines after pressuring Queen-Regent
            Maria Cristina of Spain, thus sealing Rizal's fate.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Execution: </strong>Moments before his execution on December
            30, 1896 by a squad of Filipino soldiers of the Spanish Army, a
            backup force of regular Spanish Army troops stood ready to shoot the
            executioners should they fail to obey orders. The Spanish Army
            Surgeon General requested to take his pulse: it was normal. Aware of
            this the sergeant commanding the backup force hushed his men to
            silence when they began raising "vivas" with the highly partisan
            crowd of Peninsular and Mestizo Spaniards. His last words were those
            of Jesus Christ: "consummatum est" – "it is finished."
          </p>

          <p>
            He was secretly buried in Pacò Cemetery in Manila with no
            identification on his grave. His sister Narcisa toured all possible
            gravesites and found freshly turned earth at the cemetery with
            guards posted at the gate. Assuming this could be the most likely
            spot, there never having been any ground burials, she made a gift to
            the caretaker to mark the site "RPJ", Rizal's initials in reverse.
